                <h2>Site Development Report</h2>

                <h3>Learning Experience</h3>
                <p>My journey into web development through this module has been both challenging and rewarding. As a Computer Science student at the University of Northampton, this was my first serious attempt at building a complete website from scratch. The learning curve was steep, but each hurdle contributed significantly to my growth as a developer.</p>
                
                <p>Initially, I struggled with CSS layouts and responsive design. Concepts like Flexbox and Grid seemed complex at first, but through continuous practice and references such as <a href="https://css-tricks.com" class="reference-link">CSS-Tricks</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org" class="reference-link">MDN Web Docs</a>, I gradually gained confidence and clarity.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "One of my biggest achievements was implementing a fully responsive navigation menu that transforms into a hamburger menu on mobile devices — something I initially thought was impossible without JavaScript!"
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Development Process</h3>
                <p>The website was developed in several key phases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planning Phase (Week 1–2):</strong> Researched portfolio website designs, created wireframes, and outlined the site structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Development (Week 3–4):</strong> Built the basic HTML layout and applied core CSS styling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsive Design (Week 5–6):</strong> Adjusted layout for various screen sizes and added mobile responsiveness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing & Refinement (Week 7–8):</strong> Conducted cross-browser testing and resolved layout and compatibility issues.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
                <p>The design approach was influenced by modern portfolio trends and material design principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Color Scheme:</strong> I used a professional palette including #2c3e50 (dark blue) and #3498db (light blue). These were inspired by the University of Northampton’s branding to maintain an academic and polished feel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Typography:</strong> The font 'Segoe UI' was chosen for its clarity and readability, with fallbacks to ensure consistency across devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layout:</strong> A clean, minimalistic structure was inspired by examples from <a href="https://www.awwwards.com" class="reference-link">Awwwards</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com" class="reference-link">Dribbble</a>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
                <p>Some of the key challenges I encountered included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating a fully responsive navigation bar without JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Maintaining consistent spacing and alignment across screen sizes</li>
                    <li>Ensuring proper contrast and accessibility throughout the site</li>
                    <li>Fixing cross-browser compatibility bugs, especially in Firefox</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Enhance interactivity using JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Optimize performance and loading times</li>
                    <li>Showcase additional projects as they are completed</li>
